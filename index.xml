Debouncing avoids unnecessarily handling every event, especially mouse input events which are generated constantly while the mouse pointer moves.</description></item><item><title>Introducing sessiond</title><link>https://twiddlingbits.net/introducing-sessiond/</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 Apr 2021 17:26:11 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://twiddlingbits.net/introducing-sessiond/</guid><description>When I began using Linux on the desktop in ~2012, I experimented with the prevalent desktop environments (Gnome, KDE, etc.), but was quickly drawn into the realm of tiling window managers by their promise of increased productivity and customization. While I believe these promises were fulfilled, tiling window managers were not without a significant shortcoming: they are solely window managers, lacking the integrated suite of software and applications that put the environment in desktop environments.</description></item><item><title>About</title><link>https://twiddlingbits.net/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://twiddlingbits.net/about/</guid><description>I&amp;#39;m James Reed, a metamodern homo sapien and open source software developer.
